With this plugin, you can easily create user votes on Posts.

### Creating votes

Anyone who can post on Posts can start a vote from the post UI. A vote can have up to 4 choices, and you can set the expiration date and whether to reveal the results immediately or not.

### Public and Private

Votes can be added to both public and private posts. Votes on public posts can be voted by anyone who views them, while votes on private posts can only be participated by members who have a membership. They are always limited to one vote per person.

### List

A page that lists only posts with vote is automatically generated, and it helps viewers to check the trends of voting at any time.
